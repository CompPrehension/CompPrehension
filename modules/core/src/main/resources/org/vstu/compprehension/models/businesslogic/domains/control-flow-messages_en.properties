ctrlflow_CorrespondingEndMismatched = Bad trace: ${BEGIN} ended as ${A}.
ctrlflow_EndedDeeper = An action ends only when all its nested actions have ended, so ${A} cannot end until ${INNER} ends as ${INNER} is a part of ${A}.
ctrlflow_EndedShallower = Action ${phased-A} can't end ${BEGIN} as ${BEGIN} contains ${A}.
ctrlflow_WrongContext = ${A} can't be executed inside of ${CONTEXT} because ${A} is not a direct part of ${CONTEXT}.
ctrlflow_OneLevelShallower = ${A} cannot be executed within ${CONTEXT} because ${A} is an element of ${PARENT}, so start ${PARENT} first.
ctrlflow_TooEarlyInSequence = A sequence executes its nested actions in order, so ${A} cannot be executed before ${phased-MISSING}.
ctrlflow_TooLateInSequence = A sequence executes its nested actions in order, so ${A} cannot be executed after ${PREVIOUS}.

ctrlflow_NoBranchWhenConditionIsTrue = A selection statement executes its branch when the corresponding condition is true. Selection statement ${ALT} must execute the branch ${EXPECTED_BRANCH} because its condition ${LATEST_ALT_COND} is true.
ctrlflow_LastFalseNoEnd = When all conditions of a selection statement are false and "ELSE" branch does not exist, the selection does nothing. Selection statement ${ALT} does not have an 'else' branch so it must finish because its condition(s) ${ALT_COND} is (are) false.

ctrlflow_NoAlternativeEndAfterBranch = A selection statement finishes after executing one branch. Selection statement ${ALT} executed its branch ${BRANCH} and should finish.
ctrlflow_LastConditionIsFalseButNoElse = A selection statement executes its "ELSE" branch only if all conditions are false. Selection statement ${ALT} must execute its branch "ELSE" because the condition(s) ${ALT_COND} evaluated to false.

ctrlflow_LoopEndsWithoutCondition = The finish of a loop is determined by its condition. Since the condition ${LOOP_COND} is not evaluated yet, the loop ${LOOP} must not end.
ctrlflow_LoopStartIsNotCondition = A ${kind_of_loop} loop is a pre-test loop. So the loop ${LOOP} should start by evaluating its condition ${LOOP_COND}.
ctrlflow_LoopStartIsNotIteration = A DO loop is a post-test loop. Therefore, loop ${LOOP} should begin with an iteration.
ctrlflow_LoopContinuedAfterFailedCondition = A loop ends when its condition becomes false. Since condition ${LOOP_COND} is false, loop ${LOOP} cannot continue.
ctrlflow_IterationAfterFailedCondition = A loop ends when its condition becomes false. Since condition ${LOOP_COND} is false, the iteration of loop ${LOOP} cannot start.
ctrlflow_NoConditionAfterIteration = After an iteration of ${kind_of_loop} loop, its condition must be evaluated to determine whether to continue the loop or finish it. After an iteration of loop ${LOOP}, its condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated.
ctrlflow_NoConditionBetweenIterations = After an iteration of ${kind_of_loop} loop, it is to determine whether the loop continues or ends. Before proceeding to the next iteration of loop ${LOOP}, its condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated.
ctrlflow_LoopStartsNotWithInit = A FOR loop starts from initializing its variable. Begin loop ${LOOP} from executing its initialization ${INIT}.
ctrlflow_InitNotAtLoopStart = The initialization of a FOR loop is executed once at the beginning of the loop. Initialization ${INIT} should not be executed after ${A}.
ctrlflow_NoConditionAfterForInit = A FOR loop is a pre-test loop, so it should evaluate its condition before its first iteration. Condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated after initialization ${INIT}.
ctrlflow_IterationAfterForInit = A FOR loop is a pre-test loop, it won't start an iteration if its condition is false at the beginning. After initialization ${INIT} condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated.

ctrlflow_UpdateNotAfterIteration = The FOR loop has an advancement that updates the loop variable. The advancement ${UPDATE} should only be executed after the iteration of loop ${LOOP}.
ctrlflow_ForConditionAfterIteration = A FOR loop has an advancement that updates the loop variable before the loop condition is evaluated. After iteration of loop ${LOOP} its advancement ${UPDATE} should be executed.
ctrlflow_NoConditionAfterForUpdate = The FOR loop has an increment command that updates the loop variable before the loop condition is evaluated. After the advancement command ${UPDATE} the condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated.
ctrlflow_NoForeachUpdateAfterSuccessfulCondition = The FOREACH loop traverses a collection or iterates over an iterator and proceeds to the next element is one exists. Since the check for the next element is successful (the condition is true), the next element should be retrieved and the iteration of the ${B} loop should begin.
ctrlflow_ForeachUpdateNotAfterSuccessfulCondition = The FOREACH loop traverses a collection or iterator and must go to the next element immediately after checking for the next element. The ${B} loop should go to the next element right after a successful check for the next element.
ctrlflow_NoIterationAfterForeachUpdate = The FOREACH loop traverses a collection or iterator and must start a new iteration after moving to the next element. Immediately after the advance to the next element, the iteration of the ${B} loop should begin.
ctrlflow_IterationNotAfterForeachUpdate = The FOREACH loop traverses a collection or iterator, and should start a new iteration immediately after moving to the next element. Right after the advance to the next element the iteration of the ${B} loop should start.


# correct step explanation templates

ctrlflow_SequenceBegin = Sequence executes its statements in their order, so for sequence ${SEQ}, its statement ${INNER} should be executed first.
ctrlflow_SequenceNext = Sequence executes its statements in their order, so in sequence ${SEQ}, its statement ${PREVIOUS} should be followed by statement ${NEXT}.
ctrlflow_SequenceEnd = Sequence executes its actions exactly once per run, so sequence ${SEQ} finishes after all its actions completed.
ctrlflow_AltBegin = A selection statement starts with evaluating its first condition, so selection ${ALT} should start with evaluating its condition ${ALT_COND}.
ctrlflow_AltBranchBegin = A selection statement executes its branch when corresponding condition is true. As condition ${ALT_COND} is true, branch ${BRANCH} should begin.
ctrlflow_NextAltCondition = A selection statement evaluates its consequent condition when current condition is false. As condition ${ALT_COND} is false, condition ${NEXT_COND} should be evaluated.
ctrlflow_AltElseBranchBegin = A selection statement executes its ELSE branch when all of its conditions are false. As condition ${ALT_COND} is false, selection ${ALT} should execute its ELSE branch.
ctrlflow_AltEndAllFalse = A selection statement finishes when all of its conditions are false and the ELSE branch is absent. Selection ${ALT} should finish.
ctrlflow_AltEndAfterBranch = A selection statement executes at most one of its branches at a time. Selection statement branch has executed, and now selection statement ${ALT} should end.
ctrlflow_PreCondLoopBegin =  A WHILE loop (as a pre-test loop) evaluates its condition before its iteration begins. As ${LOOP} loop is a WHILE loop, its condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated in the beginning of the loop.
ctrlflow_PostCondLoopBegin = A DO-WHILE loop (as a post-test loop) evaluates its condition after its iteration ends. As ${LOOP} loop is a DO-WHILE loop, its iteration should begin in the beginning of the loop.
ctrlflow_IterationBeginOnTrueCond = A ${kind_of_loop} loop continues under the true condition. As loop condition ${LOOP_COND} is true, the iteration of loop ${LOOP} should start.
ctrlflow_IterationBeginOnFalseCond = The loop exit condition is false, and now the iteration should start because the loop ${DO_UNTIL} continues under the false condition. (~)
ctrlflow_LoopEndOnFalseCond = A ${kind_of_loop} loop finishes when condition is false. As loop condition ${LOOP_COND} is false, loop ${LOOP} should end.
ctrlflow_NormalLoopEnd = The loop exit condition is true, and now the loop should end because the loop ${DO_UNTIL} stops under the true condition (~)
ctrlflow_LoopCondBeginAfterIteration = A loop evaluates its condition once its iteration completed. As iteration of ${LOOP} loop finished, loop condition ${LOOP_COND} should be evaluated.
